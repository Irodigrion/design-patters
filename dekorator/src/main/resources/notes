- Decorating objects are the same as decorated objects
- One main object (main product eg. CafeSpecial or Espresso) cam be wrapped with one or multiple decorators
- Thanks to decorators and decorated objects are of the same type, we can pass as an argument object which is already decorated instead of original (not decorated) object
- Decorator adds its own behaviour before or/and after delegating to decorated object.
